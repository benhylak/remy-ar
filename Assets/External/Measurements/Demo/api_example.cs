/* A sample of how to retrieve data from the Measurements API. See the documentation for 
 * all the available data available. While in play mode, view the inspector window for
 * the API Example gameobject. By default, the Sphere in the demo is selected, but you 
 * can drop in any gameobject that has the Measurements script attached.
 * 
 * As the sphere moves around randomly, you can see how the distance values change. 
 * As you move and scale the other objects in the scene, the GUI should update as well.
